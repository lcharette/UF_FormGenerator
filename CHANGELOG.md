## [4.0.0]
- Form nows register element class, instead of using hardcoded string.
- Form has new `registerType` method to register new custom elements. `getType(string $name)` and `getTypes()` can be used to get the class for a type (eg. 'text', 'select', etc.) abd a list of types. `removeType` will unregister a type.
- Form still fallback to `Text` type if type is not found, but this can now be changed with `getDefaultType` and `setDefaultType`.
- Form uses `RequestSchemaRepository` instead of `RequestSchemaInterface`.
- Stricter PHP7 type throughout.
- Renamed `BaseInput` to `Input`.
- `Input` has new `setValue`, `getElement`, `setElement`, `getName` & `setName` methods.
- Checkbox element now pass the value to non-binary checkbox.

## [2.1.1]
- Fix issue with the select macro

## [2.1.0]
- Completely refactored how form fields are parsed, including how default value are defined. Each input type now defines it's own class for defining default values and transforming some input.
- Twig templates updated to reflect the new parser.
- Twig macros changed from `*.generate(name, value)` to `*.generate(input)`.
- **`Bool` type changed to `checkbox`**.
- Removed the `number` Twig template (Will use the text input one).
- Added unit tests.
- Support for any attributes in the schema. For example, if you need to add a data attribute to a field, your schema would be:
```
"myField" : {
    "form" : {
        "type" : "text",
        "label" : "My Field",
        "icon" : "fa-pencil",
        "data-something" : "blah"
    }
}
```

## [2.0.0]
- Updated for UserFrosting v4.1.x

The custom `RequestSchema` have been removed. Instead of building the form directly on the schema using `$schema->initForm()`, you now create a new Form using `$form = new Form($schema)` and go on from there. Handling complex schema can now be done using the new loader system from UF 4.1.

`$schema->generateForm();` has also been changed to `$form->generate();`.
